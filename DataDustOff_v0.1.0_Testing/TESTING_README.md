# DataDustOff - Beta Testing

Thanks for testing DataDustOff! 🎉

## What is this?

DataDustOff helps you find and clean up files you haven't touched in months/years. Perfect for decluttering Downloads, Documents, or any messy folder.

## Installation

1. Download and extract the ZIP file
2. Double-click `DataDustOff_0.1.0_x64_en-US.msi` to install
3. Open DataDustOff from Start Menu

## How to Use

1. Click "📁 Select Folder"
2. Choose a folder to scan (try Downloads first)
3. Click "🚀 Start Scan"
4. Review untouched files sorted by age
5. Use "🗑️ Trash" (safe, recoverable) or "❌ Delete" (permanent)

## Important Notes

⚠️ **Start with a test folder!** Don't scan your entire C: drive on the first try.

🗑️ **Trash files go to:** `C:\Users\YourName\DataDustOff_Trash` (you can recover them manually)

❌ **Delete is permanent** - use carefully!

## What to Test

- Does it install correctly?
- Can you scan different folders?
- Are the file ages accurate?
- Do the Trash and Delete buttons work?
- Any crashes or errors?
- Is the UI clear and easy to understand?
